			<p>When I first started programming simple, linear, text based games in BASIC, I had no worries over the dark spiraling pit of code complexity. Later, when things got difficult, hot programming methodologies with familiar three letter acronyms presented a solution. Before even encountering true levels of unmanagability in my programs, I agonized over the proper implementation of these ideals. I didn't realize that I had actually fallen into a self fulfilling prophecy.</p>
			<p>I'm not here to tell you that all code complexity springs from overzealous adherance to carefully crafted abstractions, though I do think it tends to be a common cause of <em>uneccessary</em> complexity. What I'm actually here to say is that the inclination to abstract and generalize is driven by fear of the spiraling pit. We don't want the program to wriggle out of our grasp, forcing us to tear it down and start again.</p>
			<p>Well, how in the hell is building yet another abstract factory, MVC architecture, or singleton, any less scary than having to do some good, honest refactoring? Being dead wrong about an abstraction, after all, carries a lot more weight than being dead wrong about a piece of well written imperative code. Relish the freedom of a new project. Explore the problem space and find redundancies. Embrace the fact that, yes, you will have to write that again, and be excited that you discovered a concrete improvement. All this to say that it may be useful to view ourselves more as sculptors than architects.</p>
