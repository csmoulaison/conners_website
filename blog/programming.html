			<p>I work as the system administrator for a medium sized company with a previously bereft IT department. In the year I've been here, I've learned that navigating systemic changes in business is a series of judgements on whether your considerations are a result of courage or stupidity.</p>
			<p>Regarding considerations made for yourself, in a personal programming project, for instance, the fruits of your decisions are almost always valuable insights, and this applies to decisions with both good and bad outcomes. In my personal life, I learned to feel smart and valuable based on my ability to grow from this process, and not necessarily based on the consequences. Despite my best efforts, this infected my decision making with a certain amount of hubris when I stepped into the new role.</p>
			<p>This was doubly tricky because I regarded much of my personal growth as having been centered around how to avoid needless inefficiences brought about by human nature or intuitive, but false, guesses about how best to architect systems. Of course, I had in fact only learned how to deal with inefficiencies related to personal projects touched by a single person.</p>
			<p>As a concrete example, I developed a philosophy in my personal programming projects to code solutions straightforwardly, and commit to refactoring aggressively, even if it means constant reconstruction of core loops and overarching pipelines. I had observed that the cost of programming timidly, favoring robustness above all else, outweighs the cost of constantly refactoring leaner and less robust code. Coding lean also lowers the footprint of the code involved, which means less complexity for the programmer to keep in their head.</p>
			<p>One of my first internal declarations upon entering the job was that the complexity of business is analagous to the complexity of a computer program. I presumed that ownership and understanding of the system was best attained by getting my hands dirty, working with the system, refactoring it and documenting it.</p>
			<p>I bit off more than I could chew, and set in motion a number of things the size of which I hadn't properly considered. The inertia of business is nothing </p>
