			<p>Crumble King is an arcade game about a hungry king eating food and avoiding guards, ascending the levels of a castle tower. As he eats, he gets heavier and slower to accelerate. As he runs across any groud tile, it crumbles beneath his feet. To help him stay off the ground, he can blow himself up like a balloon, performing a low gravity, floating double jump.</p>
			<p>The food cycles positions between windows in the level. They appear for him to eat and then disappear if he is too slow. Once he has eaten the food from all but one window, the simmering pot will appear. He can jump on this pot to end the level, or, if he's feeling lucky, wait for it to turn into food to start another window cycle for extra points.</p>
			<p>The game was made with an interest in semi-authentic retro limitations and experimental, minimal game design. It was returned to in short spurts over a number of years, so I've been given a chance to spend a lot of time with the possibility space.</p>
			<p>I'm currently working on putting this on a raspberry pi in an arcade cabinet, utilizing an Arduino Micro both for interfacing with the physical control panel and for sending data to an SN74689 (Tandy sound!) chip. Pretty cool.</p>
